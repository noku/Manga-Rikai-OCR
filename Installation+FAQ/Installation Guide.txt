Click on Manga-Rikai.bat to run the program
This bat file is basically a command to launch 3 different programs at the same time
(for the curious folks, right click Manga-Rikai.bat and open with NotePad to see)


When you clicked on it; three windows will open:
- The user interface on your default browser (use chrome for the best performance)
- The computer vision server on cmd.exe 
- The main backend server on cmd.exe


Techstacks: 
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Webpack
- Backend server: Nodejs, Tesseract engine
- Computer Vision server: Python, Flask, OpenCV... (for traditional CV techniques, which is what currently being used), Keras+Tensorflow (DL model only work on Ubuntu but strangely not on Window, check my flask server for more details)

Data Flow: User Interface => Backend Server => CV server (this is only for auto text detection)

Note: I couldn't find way to bundle NodeJS and Flask server conveniently without breaking so I decided to ship both Node and Python run time in the program,
which explains why the program is quite large 


About Privacy:
No, your data is not being sold to the devil or to M### Zuckerberg
In fact, there is no data being collected at all
The "servers" in the program acts simply as a medium to interact with the user interface in your browser
The only info being sent to the internet is the Japanese text to Bing to be translated to English
