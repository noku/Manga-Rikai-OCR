- The main backend server doesn't open (only user interface and one cmd.exe window opened)
Reason: 
+ Window needs security permission to open the main backend server 
Solution:
+ You will need to manually open it once when first using the program
+ Go to backendServer folder > click activateBackendServer.bat > give permission for the program to run


- The computer vision server doesn't open (I have not observed this during on any computer I tested so chances are low)
Reason:
+ Window needs security permission
Solution: 
+ You will need to manually open it once when first using the program
+ Go to backendServer folder > click activateComputerVision.bat (different name than backend server) > give permission for the program to run (I guess private is ok too, but I choose public just in case)


UnicodeDecodeError: "utf-8"codec can't decode byte 0xac in position 1: invalid start byte
Reason: 
+ Your PC name is not in English
Solution:
+ control panel > System > Computer Name > "To rename this computer click change" Change > OK 


- The program just doesn't run 
Reason: 
+ Read the error log on the server cmd.exe to see might be the cause
Solution:
+ If your Window is new or you are not a gamer, you probably need to install VC_redist 2019 
+ If that still doesn't work, contact me on Discord about your case (https://discord.com/invite/BuNuanw)
